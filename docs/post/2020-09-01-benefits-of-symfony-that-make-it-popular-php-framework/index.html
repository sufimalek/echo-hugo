<p>Many developers and programmers have shown great interest in websites and applications development in recent years. In this era whereby Internet technology is transforming every sector in the economy.</p>
<p>Internet innovation has contributed to growth of web development industry. For a website or application to work efficiently and properly, web developers needs to focus on using the right frameworks with proper functionality and reliability and I think that all had with <code>Symfony</code> PHP framework</p>
<p>I am listing down some best maybe great benefits of it.</p>
<h2 id="highly-flexible">Highly flexible</h2>
<p><code>Its dependency injector and the Event Dispatcher make it entirely configurable, with each of the bricks being fully independent.</code></p>
<p>Flexibility is a most important element in a web development project for the proper running of an application or a website to the maintenance.
Symfony is designed with incredible features that give it maximum flexibility. It has bundles of components we can call it as plugins which consists stylesheets, PHP files, Images, JavaScript and many others features.</p>
<p>Symfony is 2 in 1 framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Stack (complete version)</strong>: you want to develop a complex application and you need many functionalities.</li>
<li><strong>Microframework</strong>: as a standalone, Symfony can also be used to develop a specific functionality in one of your projects. Without having to redevelop everything and without installing the entire framework, but only the specific brick that you need.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expandable">Expandable</h2>
<p>From the smallest brick to the complete core itself, everything is presented as a “bundle” (or plug-in in Symfony language) in Symfony. Each bundle is intended to add functionality to the framework and can also be reused in another project or shared with the rest of the community.
In any case, the system of bundles allows everything to change within Symfony, including the core itself. Using the system’s interface contracts between bricks, the behavior of the framework thus can be changed at will, without requiring complete reconfiguration.</p>
<p>The main feature of the bundle is that they are decoupled. It&rsquo;s easy to reuse and reconfigure the components to build many other web applications.
This will therefore, help you as a developer to reduce the costs and time you incur during a project development.</p>
<p>The components can be used independently or be combined with custom modules of your own without any effect on the architecture and other bundle files.
They help the developer to eliminate strict architecture dependencies. This minimizes number of dependencies which then make it easier for developers to make changes without breaking other important parts of the system. Through this scenario, you will be able to create a more flexible application.</p>
<h2 id="faster-and-less-greedy">Faster and less greedy</h2>
<p>In the IT world, it is not a rare occurrence for people to become concerned with the performance of an application… once they reach the end of the project! That is, once everything has been designed at both the functional and technological level. Even if you were to take everything apart, performance optimization is no easy task.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Symfony was conceived from the start to be fast, with a strong emphasis on performance. By way of comparison, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Symfony is the fastest PHP framework<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h2 id="caching-management">Caching management</h2>
<p>Symfony has very good caching management system because MySQL executes every read query executed by Symfony.
A pool of all the statements will be retained in the MySQL, making it easy to execute them in the future.
There is another option, known as Fragment caching, which is also another feature that you can enjoy with Symfony.
This is done by caching portions or fragments of a page, so you can reduce trips to your database whenever the need arises.
Examples would be shopping basket, blog comments, member login status.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-development">The Actual Development</h2>
<p>The generic features reduce the time you take to perform routine tasks.
As a highly functional environment, Symfony also guarantees a certain comfort level for developers. By taking care of a number of unpleasant tasks (development of minor functionalities, for example), Symfony allows developers to focus on the <code>actual highlights of an application</code> and to both fully validate their role and improve their productivity.</p>
<h2 id="the-joy-of-developing">The Joy of Developing</h2>
<p>Among Symfony’s tools designed to make the life of a developer much easier, there is the legendary Web Debug Toolbar, as well as native support for development environments, detailed error pages or even native security.</p>
<h2 id="symfony-philosophy">Symfony Philosophy</h2>
<p>Once you visit the website of Symfony, you will see them talking about Symfony Philosophy. This is an important feature of Symfony, and it talks about the best practices and professional standards in web based applications. The fundamental criterion behind Symfony is that it will meet the developer’s needs. It will never let you down.</p>
